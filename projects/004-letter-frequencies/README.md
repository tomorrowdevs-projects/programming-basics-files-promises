# Text Analysis Tool - Letter Frequencies

The project allows users to analyze the frequency of letters in a given text or document.    
The program will read input from the user, analyze the frequency of each letter (both uppercase and lowercase), 
and present the results in a visually appealing format.

### Features

**User Input**.
The program will prompt the user to enter the text or provide the path to a text file they want to analyze.

**Text Processing**.
The program will clean the input text by removing punctuation, numbers, and other non-letter characters.
Remove punctuation and non-letter characters using regular expressions or string manipulation techniques.

**Letter Frequency Analysis**.
The program will calculate the frequency of each letter (case-insensitive) in the cleaned text.

**Visualization**.
The letter frequency data will be presented using a bar chart or histogram, allowing users to quickly grasp the distribution of letters in the text.

**User Interaction**.
The program will ask the user if they want to analyze another text or exit the program.
