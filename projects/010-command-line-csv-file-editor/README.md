# Command-Line CSV File Editor

Create a command-line tool that allows users to perform various editing tasks on CSV (Comma-Separated Values) 
files using a programming language of your choice.    
This project aims to provide users with a flexible and efficient way to manipulate CSV data without the need for a graphical user interface (GUI).

### Features

**CSV File Loading**. 
Implement functionality to load a CSV file from the user's input or a specified file path.

**View Data**. 
Allow users to view the contents of the loaded CSV file in a tabular format within the command-line interface.

**Add Rows and Columns**. 
Enable users to add new rows and columns to the CSV file, with the option to provide data for these new entries.

**Edit Data**.
Provide the ability to modify existing data within the CSV file, allowing users to update values in specific cells.

**Delete Rows and Columns**.
Allow users to delete rows and columns from the CSV file, either by specifying indices or criteria.

**Sort and Filter**.
Implement features to sort rows based on specific columns and filter rows based on certain conditions.

**Save Changes**. 
Provide an option to save the changes made to the CSV file, overwriting the original file or creating a new file.

**Validation and Error Handling**.
Implement checks to validate user inputs, such as ensuring valid row and column indices, proper CSV formatting, and appropriate data types.

**Command-Line Interface (CLI)**. 
Design a user-friendly CLI that guides users through various editing actions and provides clear instructions and prompts.

**Documentation**.
Create a user guide or manual that explains how to use the tool, including a list of available commands and examples.
