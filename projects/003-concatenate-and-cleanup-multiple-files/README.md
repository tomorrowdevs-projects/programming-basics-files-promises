# Concatenate and clean up multiple files

In this exercise, you will practice concatenating data from multiple text files and cleaning up the combined dataset.   
You'll work with a set of text files containing information about products and their attributes.   
Your task is to concatenate these files into a single dataset and perform some basic data cleaning tasks.

Examine the structure of the text files to understand how the data is organized.

Define functions:
- **read files**, the function will take care of read the content of each text file and store it in a 
    list or another appropriate data structure. Accepts the path as input.


- **concatenate files**, the function will take care of concatenate the content from all the text files 
    to create a single combined dataset.


- **clean dataset**, the function will take care of performing the following data cleaning tasks:
    - Remove any duplicate lines.
    - Remove any lines with missing or incomplete information.
    - Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each line.


- **save file**, the function will take care of save the cleaned and concatenated dataset to a new text file
    named combined_products.txt including a single header and with each value separated with a comma.
