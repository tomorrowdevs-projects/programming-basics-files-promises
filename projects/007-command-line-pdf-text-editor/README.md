# Command-Line PDF Text Editor

Develop a command-line tool that enables users to perform text editing operations on PDF files.
This project aims to provide a convenient way to manipulate text within PDF files without requiring a graphical user interface.

### Features

**PDF Text Extraction**. 
Implement a feature to extract the text content from a given PDF file. 

**Text Replacement**. 
Allow users to specify a search string and a replacement string to perform text replacement within the PDF document.   
The tool should locate instances of the search string and replace them with the specified replacement string.

**Text Addition**. 
Provide functionality to add new text to specific locations within the PDF document.   
Users should be able to specify the page number, position, and content of the new text.

**Text Deletion**. 
Enable users to delete specific text content from the PDF file.    
This could involve specifying the text to be deleted or a range of text to remove.

**PDF Merging**.
Extend the tool to support merging multiple PDF files. 
Users can provide a list of PDF files to merge, and the tool should concatenate their pages into a single output PDF.

**PDF Splitting**. 
Implement a feature to split a PDF file into multiple smaller PDF files based on page ranges specified by the user.

**Error Handling**. 
Handle cases where the provided PDF files are not valid or when specified text is not found within the document.    
Provide clear error messages to guide users.

**User Input**.
Implement a command-line interface that accepts user inputs for different text editing operations.
